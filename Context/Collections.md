Facechains — The Signature

The facechain is the heart of Rediant. Inspired by tribal face markings and sacred symmetry, it transforms the bridge of the nose into a canvas.

A delicate nosepiece sits gracefully in place, curving like an ornament once painted by desert tribes.

Fine chains extend outward, meeting at the ears — as if forming a second set of earrings, symmetrical and mesmerizing.

Each design features subtle details: feathers, geometric patterns, floral silhouettes, or crystal drops.

Facechains are not quiet. They demand attention. They draw eyes, provoke conversations, and make their wearer unforgettable.

Bodychains — Flowing Geometry

The bodychain traces the contours of the body, outlining form with elegant symmetry.

Worn over clothing or against skin, bodychains bring a sense of ritual and strength.

They echo the geometry of armor, yet remain delicate, bohemian, and free.

Some feature sacred motifs or subtle pendants, catching light and movement.

Rediant bodychains turn the body itself into art — a living sculpture.

Headchains — The Crown Reimagined

The headchain is a modern crown.

Resting on the forehead and hair, it recalls ancient adornments once worn by rulers, shamans, and mystics.

Each piece is light, flowing, and radiant, combining minimal modern lines with symbolic touches.

Feathers, half-moons, or sacred geometry may hang lightly from the chains, creating movement with every step.

Headchains are designed to awaken your inner sovereign — subtle, powerful, and magnetic.

Earrings — A Dialogue of Details

Earrings at Rediant are never static.

They are made by combining metal parts from diverse sources, each shaped like a story: half-moons, leaves, feathers, suns, or faces.

The designs are asymmetrically balanced, playful yet elegant.

They complement the larger chains — or stand alone as delicate sparks of personality.

Each pair is a reminder that details matter. They complete the dialogue between self-expression and presence.
