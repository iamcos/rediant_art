Craftsmanship

At Rediant, jewelry is not mass-produced — it is crafted. Each piece carries the mark of time, intention, and artistry. Currently, we use traditional lost-wax casting methods, with plans to integrate modern 3D printing technology in the future. Our creations reflect a deep respect for both tradition and innovation.

From Wax to Metal

One of the oldest jewelry-making traditions begins with a block of wax. The form is carefully carved by hand, revealing patterns, textures, and details as though sculpted from air.

From there, the wax model is encased in plaster, and molten silver or brass is poured in. As the metal flows, the wax melts away — leaving behind a perfect casting of the original vision.

This technique, called lost-wax casting, has been used for thousands of years — from tribal ornaments to Renaissance masterpieces. At Rediant, we carry this lineage forward, shaping modern facechains, bodychains, and earrings with the same reverence for material and fire.

The Art of Lost-Wax Casting (Current Method)

Currently, all Rediant pieces are created using the traditional lost-wax casting method. This ancient technique allows us to create jewelry that is both impossibly delicate and strong — symmetrical filigree nosepieces, feather-like motifs, and sacred geometry patterns that feel as light as lace yet endure like metal.

Every curve and detail is intentional, every piece inspired by sketches hand-drawn by the founder. This traditional method is not outdated — it becomes a timeless chisel, an extension of human imagination and ancient wisdom.

Future: 3D Printing Integration

While we honor the past, we're also developing plans to integrate modern 3D printing technology for future collections. This will allow us to create even more complex geometries while maintaining the soulful quality of handcrafted jewelry.

Metals That Speak

We work with metals that carry both beauty and strength:

Silver: luminous, timeless, flowing like moonlight

Brass: earthy, warm, reminiscent of ancient ornaments

Steel: modern, resilient, sharp with clarity

Gold plating: a radiant touch that elevates the design without excess

Each is chosen not for luxury alone, but for the way it complements the soul of the design.

Hand, Eye, Soul

At the center of it all is the human hand. Even when we use modern methods, each piece begins with a drawing — a vision sketched in flowing lines, sometimes reminiscent of Leonardo’s notebooks, other times inspired by desert tribes’ face paintings.

Every Rediant ornament is an invitation to see jewelry as more than an accessory. It is an object of craft, a fragment of history reborn, and a mirror of individuality.
