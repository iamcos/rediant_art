Facechains — The Modern Echo of Ancient Markings

Facechains are the soul of Rediant — our most iconic and daring creation.
They are inspired by the painted faces of ancient desert tribes, where lines, dots, and symbols carried stories of strength, belonging, and beauty.

We reimagined those marks not as pigments but as metal and chain.
A delicate ornament rests on the bridge of the nose, with chains flowing outward to the ears, creating a second set of earrings in perfect symmetry. Each facechain is both a mask and a mirror — it conceals nothing yet transforms everything.

Why Wear a Facechain?

It makes you the center of attention: people are drawn in, curious, inspired to ask.

It is unisex — designed for both men and women who want to stand out.

It merges the bohemian spirit with modern elegance, balancing boldness and grace.

It’s not costume jewelry — it’s a contemporary ritual ornament, a way to signal your uniqueness.

Design Language

Nosepiece: A thin, laser-cut metal ornament shaped to the natural curve of the bridge.

Chains: Fine silver, brass, or plated links extending behind the ears, graceful yet strong.

Symmetry: Each side adorned with mirrored motifs — feathers, geometric forms, or crystals.

Texture: Featherlight but striking, designed to move with you, catching light and attention.

The Facechain as Art

Each Facechain is more than a jewel — it is a living artwork worn on the face.
It recalls forgotten rituals of self-marking, yet it speaks fluently in the language of fashion today.

When you wear one, you’re not just accessorizing. You are telling the world:
“I am here. I am different. I am Rediant.”
