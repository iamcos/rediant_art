About the Founder

At the heart of Rediant is its founder, Svetlana — a young woman with red hair and a radiant presence that inspired the brand’s name.

She is not a distant designer hidden behind polished studios and corporate walls. She is an artist, a traveler, and a seeker of beauty who brings her pure soul and creative curiosity into every piece she makes.

The Beginning

Svetlana's journey began in Saint Petersburg, where her incredible desire to create something truly unique first took root. Long before facechains became reality, the idea lived in her mind — a vision of jewelry that would transform the face into a canvas of self-expression.

What fascinated her was not luxury for its own sake, but the way adornment could transform identity — how a chain, a mark, or a symbol could make someone unforgettable, drawing eyes, attention, and conversations.

Before bringing facechains to life, Svetlana explored the world of jewelry through epoxy creations and other experimental pieces. Each project was a step closer to understanding what she truly wanted to create — something that would make people unforgettable, drawing eyes, attention, and conversations.

The Vision

With Rediant, Svetlana sought to reimagine these traditions for the modern world:

Facechains as a living echo of tribal face paintings

Bodychains and headchains as reinterpretations of ancient crowns and armors

Earrings as playful yet symbolic sparks of style

Her work is not about creating static objects. It is about crafting tools of expression — jewelry that makes its wearer magnetic, seen, and remembered.

The Soul of Rediant

Svetlana radiates friendship, care, joy, and sincerity. These values flow directly into Rediant:

Jewelry that connects people rather than isolates

Pieces that invite conversation rather than silent admiration

Symbols of authenticity and individuality

Through Rediant, Svetlana shares not only jewelry, but also her worldview: that beauty is not passive — it is alive, shared, and constantly drawing people together.

Looking Forward

The founder continues to experiment with forms, metals, and ideas — moving between tradition and modernity, art and fashion.
With each new piece, Rediant grows closer to its essence: a brand where ancient art meets the modern soul.
