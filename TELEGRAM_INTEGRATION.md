# Telegram Integration for Rediant Art Blog

This document explains how to set up automatic blog post creation from your Telegram channel using the `#web` hashtag.

## Overview

The integration allows you to:
- Post content to your Telegram channel with `#web` hashtag
- Automatically create blog posts on rediant.art
- Support both English and Russian content
- Include images and media
- Maintain secure authentication

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Follow the prompts to create your bot
4. Save the bot token (you'll need this for environment variables)

### 2. Get Channel Information

1. Add your bot to your Telegram channel as an administrator
2. Get your channel ID by forwarding a message from your channel to `@userinfobot`
3. Save the channel ID

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here

# Security (optional but recommended)
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

The integration is already set up in your project. Just deploy:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Set Webhook (Optional)

For production, you can set up a webhook instead of polling:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://rediant-art2.vercel.app/api/telegram-webhook"}'
```

## Usage

### Creating Blog Posts

1. **Post to your Telegram channel** with the `#web` hashtag
2. **Include images** if desired (they'll be automatically downloaded)
3. **Use additional hashtags** for categorization:
   - `#featured` - Makes the post featured
   - `#en` or `#ru` - Forces language (auto-detected otherwise)
   - Any other tags for categorization

### Example Telegram Post

```
