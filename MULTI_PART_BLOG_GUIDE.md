# Multi-Part Blog Post System

This guide explains how to create comprehensive blog articles from multiple Telegram posts using the `#blog` hashtag system.

## Overview

The multi-part blog system allows you to:
- Create long-form articles from multiple Telegram posts
- Include images, videos, and Tribute products
- Automatically sequence and combine content
- Support both English and Russian content
- Maintain draft status until complete

## Hashtag System

### Basic Structure

#blog [blog_id] [part_number] [additional_tags]
```

### Examples
