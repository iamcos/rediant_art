                    <h2>Meet Svetlana</h2>
                    <p>At the heart of Rediant is its founder, Svetlana â€” a young woman with red hair and a radiant presence that inspired the brand's name.</p>
                    
                    <p>She is not a distant designer hidden behind polished studios and corporate walls. She is an artist, a dreamer, and a creator who brings her pure soul and relentless creative curiosity into every piece she makes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Beginning in Saint Petersburg</h3>
                    <p>Svetlana's journey began in the creative heart of Saint Petersburg, where an incredible desire to create something truly unique first took root. Long before facechains became reality, the idea lived in her mind â€” a vision of jewelry that would transform the face into a canvas of self-expression.</p>
                    
                    <p>This wasn't just a passing thought; it was a persistent dream that refused to be ignored. The concept of facechains had been brewing in her imagination for years before she finally brought it to life.</p>
                    
                    <h3>From Epoxy to Metal</h3>
                    <p>Before bringing facechains to life, Svetlana explored the world of jewelry through epoxy creations and other experimental pieces. Each project was a step closer to understanding what she truly wanted to create â€” something that would make people unforgettable, drawing eyes, attention, and conversations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Her work with epoxy jewelry taught her about form, texture, and the relationship between material and meaning. But it was the transition to metal â€” to the ancient art of lost-wax casting and the timeless elegance of silver and gold â€” that allowed her vision to truly shine.</p>

                    <h3>From Wax to Metal</h3>
                    <p>One of the oldest jewelry-making traditions begins with a block of wax. The form is carefully carved by hand, revealing patterns, textures, and details as though sculpted from air.</p>
                    
                    <p>From there, the wax model is encased in plaster, and molten silver or brass is poured in. As the metal flows, the wax melts away â€” leaving behind a perfect casting of the original vision.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Art of CNC Laser Cutting</h3>
                    <p>While we honor the past, we also embrace the tools of today. Many Rediant designs are realized through ultra-precise CNC laser cutting, where thin sheets of silver, steel, or brass are etched with microscopic detail.</p>
                    
                    <p>This allows us to create jewelry that is both impossibly delicate and strong â€” symmetrical filigree nosepieces, feather-like motifs, and sacred geometry patterns that feel as light as lace yet endure like steel.</p>
